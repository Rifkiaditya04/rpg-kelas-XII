# KELAS 12 — THE FINAL MISSION
## MASTER CONTROL — v1.1 CONTINUATION

> **MASTER CONTROL v1.1 adalah LANJUTAN RESMI dari `Alur Kerja Proyek/00-MASTER-CONTROL.md`.**
> Dokumen ini tidak menggantikan, menghapus, atau membatalkan Master Control pertama. Untuk setiap sesi kerja, keputusan, perubahan, implementasi, QA, atau promotion, **WAJIB membaca lengkap `00-MASTER-CONTROL.md` terlebih dahulu dan kemudian membaca lengkap `00-MASTER-CONTROL-v1.1.md` ini**.

## 0. Aturan kontinuitas
- `00-MASTER-CONTROL.md` = Master Control utama / bagian pertama.
- `00-MASTER-CONTROL-v1.1.md` = kelanjutan resmi / bagian kedua.
- Keduanya bersama-sama membentuk Master Control aktif proyek.
- Jangan membuat ringkasan pengganti yang menyebabkan pembacaan Master Control pertama dilewati.
- Jika ada konflik, tandai `conflicting`, cross-validate artefak sumber, dan dokumentasikan resolusinya di PROJECT LOG.

## 1. Progression v1 — PROMOTED / APPROVED
- Progression System Specification v1: APPROVED.
- Controlled World 1 Progression Prototype v1: IMPLEMENTED.
- Progression QA / Regression Gate: PASS — user-verified live browser evidence.
- Progression v1: PROMOTED / APPROVED.
- Evidence includes fresh private-browser state, completion XP, Mission Complete, learning evidence accumulation, accuracy, anti-farming, unlock eligibility, and persistence.
- Training Room was deferred from Mission System v1 and is now implemented as the next controlled RPG-layer component.
- No universal player-level curve or mastery threshold is approved without a separate design decision.

## 2. RPG Layer v1 — PROMOTED / APPROVED
- World 1 RPG Layer & Training Room Specification v1: APPROVED.
- Controlled World 1 RPG Layer Prototype v1: IMPLEMENTED.
- Controlled World 1 RPG Layer QA / Regression Gate: **PASS — user-verified browser evidence**.
- World 1 RPG Layer v1: **PROMOTED / APPROVED**.
- Promotion record: `Alur Kerja Proyek/PROJECT LOG/022-World-1-RPG-Layer-Promotion-v1.md`.
- QA record: `Alur Kerja Proyek/PROJECT LOG/021-World-1-RPG-Layer-QA-Gate-PASS-and-Promotion-v1.md`.
- Promoted integration scope: Explore → NPC/Context → Learn → Mission → Progression → Learning Weakness / Training Hook.
- Verified runtime boundaries: Learn/context does not mutate XP or Mission Complete; Training Hook does not award XP; Retry remains distinct from Training Room; mission/progression state persists and M01 → M02 unlock remains deterministic.

## 3. Training Room v1 — QA PASS / PROMOTION PENDING
- World 1 Training Room Specification v1: **APPROVED**.
- Approval record: `Alur Kerja Proyek/PROJECT LOG/024-Training-Room-Specification-v1-Approval.md`.
- Controlled Training Room Prototype v1: **IMPLEMENTED**.
- Implementation record: `Alur Kerja Proyek/PROJECT LOG/025-Training-Room-Prototype-v1-Implementation.md`.
- Prototype: `prototype/bahasa-indonesia/world-1-training-room-prototype-v1.html`.
- Progression Training Hook integration: `prototype/bahasa-indonesia/world-1-progression-prototype-v1.html`.
- Training Room QA / Regression Gate: **PASS — user-verified live browser evidence**.
- QA record: `Alur Kerja Proyek/PROJECT LOG/026-Training-Room-QA-Gate.md`.
- Actual Training Room is not promoted yet.
- Training Room must not become an XP-farming mechanism or duplicate Mission completion rewards.
- Training Room is competency/evidence-oriented rather than a random extra-quiz loop.
- Retry/Remedial remains distinct from Training Room.
- Final mastery thresholds/algorithms remain unapproved until separately specified and approved.

## 4. Training Room implementation boundary
Implemented and live-verified flow:
`Learning Weakness → Training Hook → Competency Context → Explanation → Guided Example → Practice → Return to Mission/Progression`.

Verified runtime boundaries:
- Training Room awards 0 additional XP.
- Training Room does not increment Mission Complete.
- Existing progression state is preserved.
- Existing learning evidence is not deleted.
- Competency, Explanation/Pembekalan, Guided Example/Contoh Terbimbing, Practice, and Return to Mission were verified by live browser playtest.
- Normal-browser persistence retains previous progression history; this is expected behavior. Fresh-state testing uses a private/incognito browser.
- No account/backend persistence is introduced.
- This is a controlled prototype, not final visual presentation.

## 5. Current scope determination
The post-RPG promotion scope was formally determined as Training Room Specification v1, then approved by the user. The specification was implemented and has now passed the core live QA checks.

**Current gate: Training Room v1 Promotion Review → documented promotion decision.**

## 6. Existing project boundaries remain active
- Golden Dataset v1 remains immutable.
- Approved A–F content remains additive/versioned.
- Mission System v1 remains approved/promoted.
- Progression v1 remains approved/promoted.
- Visual Direction, Map/World Structure, Character Design v2, Camera/Character Gameplay Specification, and Visual QA remain approved according to Master Control first.
- TKA Academic Planning remains a design foundation and is not replaced by the current Training Room work.
- Light RPG Educational Platform remains the project direction; the project is not reduced to a quiz with an RPG skin.

## 7. Mandatory work-session protocol
Every future session:
**re-sync → read all `Alur Kerja Proyek` → read complete `00-MASTER-CONTROL.md` → read complete `00-MASTER-CONTROL-v1.1.md` → verify latest artifacts → Evidence / Implementation / Interpretation → cross-validation → execute.**

After work:
**verify result → document event/decision/bug/QA in PROJECT LOG → update relevant Master Control without deleting history.**

## 8. Promotion gate discipline
No component may be marked PROMOTED solely because source code looks correct. Promotion requires implementation evidence, relevant deterministic/source QA, runtime evidence when required, documented PASS, a PROJECT LOG promotion record, and traceable Master Control status.

## 9. Current milestone
**World 1 RPG Layer v1: PROMOTED / APPROVED.**

**World 1 Training Room v1: QA PASS / PROMOTION PENDING.**

**Next: Training Room v1 Promotion Review.**

Training Room QA PASS does not itself equal promotion; promotion remains a separate documented gate.
